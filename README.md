## The Lizard Spock Expansion

This is the code repo for the web UI game version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock popularized by 
The Big Bang Theory.

This is a code challenge for a job interview.  Wish me luck! 

I wanted to make a Star Wars version with Darth Vader and Spock, but that wouldn't be fair because:

* Vader force chokes Spock
* Vader's lightsaber slices scissors
* Vader levitates rock
* Vader force crumples paper
